## Creating a DB in C

Key things I want to learn with this

- How indexing really works
- How I could support a flexible schema, kinda like s3 or cassandra or other nosql dbs
- Sharding, and implementing sharding myself

... maybe more stuff later

- like maybe timescale dbs
- Apache trino ? 
- Data lakes...
- graph dbs
- Caches in data retrieval

A cool idea would be to make my own b tree implementation later on if I want to revisit that.
